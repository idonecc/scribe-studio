# Windows counterpart to fetch-bins.sh. Pulls (or builds) the three
# native binaries Scribe shells out to and lays them under
# resources/bin/windows-amd64/ so build-release.ps1 + the runtime
# BinaryPath resolver can find them inside the packaged build.
#
# Usage:
#   .\scripts\fetch-bins.ps1            # dev mode (in PATH or chocolatey)
#   .\scripts\fetch-bins.ps1 -Release   # release mode (static-ish build)
#
# Why -Release pulls static-ish artifacts: end users won't have ffmpeg /
# yt-dlp on PATH, so the .zip we ship has to carry them. whisper-cli is
# built from source — there's no widely-trusted prebuilt for Windows.
